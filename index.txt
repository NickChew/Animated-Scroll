The code starts with the <html> tag.
The <head> tag contains meta tags, which are used to specify the character encoding and viewport settings for the document.
Next is a link to style.css, which sets up all of the CSS styles for this page.
The title of this page is "Scroll Animation".
This is set in an h1 element inside a div called box that has been given class="box" .
Inside each box there are two h2 elements, one on top and one on bottom.
These are used as headers for each section of content in that particular box.
Inside each header there's another div with class="box" , but it doesn't have any heading or anything else in it yet because we haven't told it what to do yet!
We'll get back to that later when we talk about JavaScript functions like addClass() .
For now just know that these boxes will contain different sections of content throughout this webpage (and they're not limited by their position either).
After those boxes come some text: "Content 1", "Content 2", etc., followed by more boxes without headings until you reach "Content 16".
After Content 16 comes some more text: "Content 17", then another
The code creates a webpage with 20 divs, each containing a heading.
The first heading is "Content 1", the second is "Content 2", and so on.
Each of these headings are displayed in a different color.
The code also includes an animation that scrolls up and down to reveal the content below it, one by one.
