The code starts by declaring a variable called boxes.
This is an array of all the <div> elements that are inside the document with class="box".
Then it declares a function called checkBoxes which takes in one parameter, window.
The code then creates an event listener for when the user scrolls down and calls checkBoxes every time they scroll up.
The first line of code starts by creating a variable called triggerBottom which will be used to calculate how high off the bottom of the screen we need to scroll before we can see any box on screen.
Next, it loops through each element in boxes and checks if their top is less than or equal to triggerBottom.
If so, they have been scrolled too far and therefore should show up now; otherwise, they haven't been scrolled enough yet and should not show up yet (they're still hidden).
The code attempts to add a class of show when the user scrolls down and remove the class of show when the user scrolls up.
The code above has been written in order to do this, by using an event listener that will check if the top of a box is below or equal to a triggerBottom value.
